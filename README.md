### Part 2

  This part contains the implementation of the designs from Part 1 which has been divided into 5 sections.

  - api

    Contains the design and implementation of different end points for the 4 classes.

  - models

    Contains the object structure of each class.

  - persistence

    Contains the repository which has the methods that the methods in facade reference.

  - services

    Contains the facade which does the bulk of the operation called by the api.

  - tests

    Contains test files to test each of the end points of the 4 classes.

	Please navigate into the "part2" folder to see the listed examples of trail codes that you can use to test the design.
